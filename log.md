# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 1 March 2020


**Today's Progress**: I've begun with a roadmap to web development tutorial & a GitHub tutorial. I also started planning my own learning objectives - everyone keeps saying start with JavaScript!?

**Thoughts:** I have no idea about what I have taken on. I do know that I need to learn a new language & a new way of thinking if I'm going to have any success with this.



### Day 2: 2 March 2020


**Today's Progress**: Carried on with more reading & theory.

**Thoughts**: Thinking about how to focus & structure my learning pathway & objectives. I don't have a definitive plan yet. I need to do a lot of reading to absorb all of this new vocabulary & to help visualise certain explanations in my minds eye.




### Day 3: 3 March 2020

**Today's Progress**: Set up my GitHub account & downloaded VSC. Also re-reading the Hello World GitHub guide.

**Thoughts** These are the first practical exercises that I've done. I was bamboozled by the terminology & admittedly there were some questions that were beyond my understanding, but I somehow solved them for myself. Did use https://www.creativebloq.com/advice/best-code-editors to help.



### Day 4: 4 March 2020


**Today's Progress**: Slim to none

**Thoughts**: D4 - Head not in the game today - received some bad news, so nothing really practical achieved. Taking a time out now so I can make a fresh approach tomorrow... 





### Day 5: 5 March 2020


**Today's Progress**: If I considered yesterday bad, then today was worse.

**Thoughts**: D5 - Another time out. Got called to the Dr's really quickly for test results.Can't think straight, reading the same sentences repeatedly... Nothing is sinking in. I feel like I'm letting myself & others on #100DaysOfCode challenge down. We move...




### Day 6: 6 March 2020


**Today's Progress**: Getting back on track now.

**Thoughts**: Just set myself little GitHub exercises to test what I've remembered, & trying not to refer to any help guides. Did better than expected, & am feeling it again. I feel ready to do more & move on tomorrow.




### Day 7: 7 March 2020


**Today's Progress**: Non existent.

**Thoughts**: Not feeling well today, so just stuck to reading, continuing to plan my learning pathway & objectives. I do find it daunting having to create my own lesson plan when I don't even know anything about the subject I'm teaching myself about.





### Day 8: 8 March 2020


**Today's Progress**: Cooking with gas!

**Thoughts**: Actually started with HTML. I still did a lot of reading because I need to level up on my terminology & the background theory is important for how I learn.
