# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 1 March 2020


**Today's Progress**: I've begun with a roadmap to web development tutorial & a GitHub tutorial. I also started planning my own learning objectives - everyone keeps saying start with JavaScript!?

**Thoughts:** I have no idea about what I have taken on. I do know that I need to learn a new language & a new way of thinking if I'm going to have any success with this.



### Day 2: 2 March 2020


**Today's Progress**: Carried on with more reading & theory.

**Thoughts**: Thinking about how to focus & structure my learning pathway & objectives. I don't have a definitive plan yet. I need to do a lot of reading to absorb all of this new vocabulary & to help visualise certain explanations in my minds eye.




### Day 3: 3 March 2020

**Today's Progress**: Set up my GitHub account & downloaded VSC. Also re-reading the Hello World GitHub guide.

**Thoughts** These are the first practical exercises that I've done. I was bamboozled by the terminology & admittedly there were some questions that were beyond my understanding, but I somehow solved them for myself. Did use https://www.creativebloq.com/advice/best-code-editors to help.
